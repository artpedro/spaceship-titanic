# Spaceship Titanic Solution

Welcome to my spaceship titanic prediction solution! This repository showcases my approach to solving the classic Spaceship Titanic prediction competition problem on Kaggle.In this competition the task is to predict whether a passenger was transported to an alternate dimension during the Spaceship Titanic's collision with the spacetime anomaly. The goal of this project is to explore the data features and train and build predictive models.

## Project Overview

In this project, I tackle the Spaceship Titanic prediction problem using various machine learning techniques. The main steps include:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2. Feature Engineering
3. Model Building
4. Model Evaluation

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from the Kaggle competition. It contains a set of personal records from passengers, including their Age, Home Planet, Destination... You can find the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic/data).

## Usage

Follow these steps to run the project:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:artpedro/spaceship-titanic.git
    ```
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
3. Open the notebook files and run the cells to see the analysis and results.

## Results

The key findings and model performance metrics are documented in the notebook. Some highlights include:

- **Data Insights**: Identified key features engineering from features provided showing correlation to the target variable through EDA.
- **Model Performance**: Achieved fairly high accuracy and precision with different model with a 0.80149 accuracy.
